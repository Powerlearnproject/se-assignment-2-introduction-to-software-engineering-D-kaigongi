SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering Instructions: Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions: Define Software Engineering: Application of principles, methods, and tools in developing and maintaining software systems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software development involves the conceptual process of developing the software from the initial idea to its final delivery- the entire process of SDL,  however traditional programming has a narrow and specialist focus which is on the technical code writing of the software. Traditional programming involves implementing the actual codes, testing, deploying, and maintaining.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
1.	Planning/Requirement- this phase involves collection of the stakeholder software development requirements, and estimating the budget and other resources.
2.	Design – the developer orchestrates the best route to coming up with the software.
3.	Implementation –this involves the actual coding.
4.	Testing – this involves automatic and manual testing of the software to ensure there are no bugs and the product quality per requirements are meet.
5.	Deployment – This phase involves releasing the production software to the customers or clients.
6.	Maintenance- This phase involves resolving customers' issues, fixing bugs, maintaining overall software performance, etc.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:
The agile SDLC model arranges the phases in several development cycles. The team iterates through each phase rapidly delivering only small incremental software changes in each cycle. 
The waterfall SDLC model arranges the phases sequentially and the team works on each phase depending on the outcome of the previous phase. 
The agile model works on all phases at the same time with small iterative cycles while the waterfall works on each phase at a time. The waterfall is preferred for small projects while agile is preferred for long-term projects. 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirement engineering is the discipline of establishing user requirements and developing a framework for meeting those needs. It involves five steps as below:
•	Elicitation: gathering information from the stakeholders, information about existing systems of the same caliber, business manuals, and customers. The information can be gathered in several ways including but not limited to interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observations. 
•	Analysis; this involves doing the cost-benefit analysis of the project. This could entail technical feasibility, operational feasibility, and economical feasibility. The big question is, is the project worth it for the client's investment?
•	Specification; this is the process of coming up with software requirement models that indicate the functional, non-functional, and constant specifications.
•	Validation; this checks whether the software system meets the stakeholder requirement and is correct and consistent.
•	Management: this is a continuous process throughout the software development life cycle that ensures that the changes are tracked and controlled ensuring the stakeholder’s requirements remain valid and relevant. Also, the cost is managed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
The importance of requirement engineering includes:
•	Ensures the software developed meets the requirements
•	Potential problems can be identified and resolved on time
•	Creates a foundation for the development process reducing the risks.

Software Design Principles: Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
 Modularity is dividing of software into components that work together to form a single functioning item. Modularity helps in maintainability in that changes can be made to one module without affecting the rest and this helps in tracking down any bug to a specific module and sorting it out without many problems. Due to the distinct nature of the modules, they can be scaled by adding new modules or enhancing the existing ones easily.                                                                                                                              

Testing in Software Engineering: Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Software testing in the process of identifying errors so that they can be removed to obtain a quality product. Below are the levels of software testing:
•	Unit testing: This involves testing individual units of the systems
•	Integration testing: this involves combining two or more units that work together and testing them as a unit
•	System testing: This involves testing all the elements of the system.
•	Acceptance testing: This involves testing that all the user requirements have been met and the system can work in the user’s environment.

Version Control Systems: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. 
A number of version control helps track and manage changes in the code and files. The system includes but is not limited to Git, Helix core, and Microsoft TFS. Below are some of the control system importance:
•	Enhance speed since they allow people to collaborate
•	They leverage the productivity of the expertise through good communication
•	They reduce the possibility of errors and conflict since all changes are traceable
•	They bridge geographical gaps by allowing people to work from any place
The most predominant features of version control include repo, clone, folk, commit, push etc:
Software Project Management: Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? The software project manager: plans and manages the entire project. They lead the team and manage resources, manage the stakeholders, and ensure the successful delivery of the product. They may face challenges such as time constraints, ambiguous expectations from clients, poor communication among the parties, ever-changing technology etc.

Software Maintenance: Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
This is the process of ensuring the system meets the market demands after the deployment. These needs could be technological changes or user needs that change with business demands. Below are different maintenance activities:
•	Adaptive Maintenance: this ensure the system cope with the new environment and keep all function working correctly.
•	Corrective Maintenance: this involves fixing bugs.
•	Preventative Maintenance: This ensures the changes and adaptation that reduce system deterioration and risk with restructuring, code optimization, and documentation updates.
•	Perfective Maintenance: this enhances functionality and usability to improve the user experience.
It is essential to maintain the software to ensure the continuity of functionalities, keep the data secure from threats, keep up with changing technologies and fix the bugs.

Software Engineering: What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Some of the ethical issues software encounters:
•	Algorithmic bias: Computers lack morality, and bias may unintentionally enter systems.
•	Personal data collection: Some software profiles users with high accuracy.
•	Weak security protection: Security is not always taken seriously.
•	Addictive design – some apps are created with the intention to permeate and mess with the social fabric of society bleeding with vices.

How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
•	Responsibility and accountability in software engineering
•	Ensure their code promotes ethical behaviors
•	Ensure their codes do not discriminate on the basis of color, gender, religion et
